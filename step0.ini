Open the terminal and type: "npx create-next-app@latest", name your project, select "yes" for everything except "default import alias"

No, go to the "page.tsx" file in the "app" folder, clean up everything and start coding.

NOTE - Although, "use client" is not an import, I put it under imports because it looks good there according to me.
